     * This file can contain various utility functions that are used across the application.
     * For example, you might have functions for formatting currency, handling dates, etc.
    *
    * Note: This file is not meant to be accessed directly via URL. It should only be included in other PHP files.
    * To prevent direct access, we check if a specific constant is defined (e.g., CASHCUE_APP). 
    * If it's not defined, we exit the script.
    * This is a common pattern in PHP applications to enhance security.
