# CashCue
CashCue is a lightweight yet powerful platform designed to help individual investors manage their stock portfolios with real-time tracking, historical analysis, and broker independence.
It is tailored for French PEA (‚ÄúPlan d‚Äô√âpargne en Actions‚Äù) but flexible enough to support multiple accounts and asset types.

Track buy/sell orders, including broker fees and realized gains/losses.
Offer clear visibility into the current and historical value of your portfolio.
Be flexible and resilient to changes in data providers.
