# CashCue
CashCue is a lightweight yet powerful platform designed to help individual investors manage their stock portfolios with real-time tracking, historical analysis, and broker independence. It is tailored for French PEA (“Plan d’Épargne en Actions”) but flexible enough to support multiple accounts and asset types.
